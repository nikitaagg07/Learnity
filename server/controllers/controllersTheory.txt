//CONTROLLERS: are functions or classes that handle the logic for a specific route. 
They are repsonsible for processing the incoming request,interacting with database if necessary and returning a response.

using controllers helps to seperate the route definitions from the business logic,making my code more organised and maintainable.

A purpose of controller in Express.js typically includes:
    1.Interact with databases or other data sources.
    2.Process request data.
    3.Perform calculations or validations.
    4.Prepare response data.

Controllers are like the brains behind the routes. They contain the logic needed to handle the request and generate a response.


// REST API's [ Representational State Transfer API ] is a s/w architectural style for creating web services. 
It defines a set of rules for how applications can communicate over the internet.

- A REST API allows different applications to share data and functionality without needing to know the internal workings of each other.

- The router directs incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller based on the URL and HTTP method. 
- Controllers contain the logic to Process tese requests, interact with services or databases and return appropriate responses. 

    1.  a controller includes all the backend logic that can be performed according to HTTP requests, including the algorithms that should be executed for particular requests.

    2. Routes, on the other hand, accept or capture all HTTP requests that come to the server for certain operations and direct these requests to the appropriate controller.

    Essentially, a route shows the path where the request should go in the controller module and specifies the operation that should happen.
